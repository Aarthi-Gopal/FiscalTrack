# FiscalTrack: Fund Performance & Cost Analyzer
**FiscalTrack** is an advanced analytical dashboard built with **Angular 11** designed to evaluate the intersection of fund costs and performance. It empowers investors and financial analysts to move beyond basic tracking and enter the realm of data-driven decision-making.

## The Concept
In the world of finance, high returns are often eroded by hidden costs. **FiscalTrack** provides a specialized environment to:
1.  **Analyze Fund Costs:** Deconstruct expense ratios, management fees, and transaction costs.
2.  **Evaluate Performance:** Compare historical returns against benchmarks and peer groups.
3.  **Optimize Decision-Making:** Use high-fidelity visualizations to identify "efficient" funds—those providing the best performance per unit of cost.

## Key Features
* **Cost-Benefit Visualization:** Dual-axis charts that overlay performance metrics against cost structures.
* **Alpha Identification:** Tools to visualize risk-adjusted returns and identify top-performing assets.
* **Efficiency Metrics:** Automated calculation of Net Return vs. Gross Expense ratios.
* **Comparative Analytics:** Side-by-side fund comparison to streamline the selection process.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Slice data by sector, asset class, or risk profile for surgical analysis.
